abstract: The majority of commonly used transport and urban models assumes that flows of people follow a spatial distribution with a distance decay from urban centres to the periphery. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity exists across cities in this distribution due to administrative boundaries, transport linkage, jobs and housing balance, and other complicated urban contexts. When detecting the functional boundary between cities, the current network analysis and most community detection methods focus on the strength of local linkages between particular zones but overlook the reasonability for distributing trips in a global sight. Moreover, considering the inter-city flow is usually tiny (10% or less) in overall flows, which may fail to support planners and policymakers appropriately. Taking the cell phone data in a typical metropolitan region (Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou) in China as a case study, we found that constrained the administrative boundaries, modifying the spatial interaction model (SIM) by dividing one regional-size 'global model' into several city-level sub-SIM models can significantly improve the goodness of fitting of travel flows, which is called modular spatial interaction model (MSIM). The paper proposed a novel regionalisation algorithm that re-assigned zones’ belonging of cities by searching for the best partition with the best goodness of fitting in MSIM. This algorithm is not only more sensitive for cross-boundary trips, and this algorithm can reflect the dynamic change of cities' functional boundaries by fitting cross-boundary trips into global trip distribution. The result shows that only a few zones within the SDH area are different from their administrative boundary at the current time point. Moreover, the results also suggest more zones are potentially staggered between Dongguan and Huizhou cities in future. These empirical-based results can help the governments and planners to understand the spatial structure in mega city-region and support their urban integration policy.
