This research aims to answer the main research question, <b>"How can we use human mobility patterns to assess the urban spatial structure during the evolution progress from cities toward a super mega-city region?‚Äù</b>
<br>
The overall research question is tackled through four more detailed research objectives as follows: <br>
a. To examine the potential difference of human mobility pattern between intra-city trips and inter-city cities trips, defining a social indicator that can describe the difference. <br>
b. To detect the implicit boundaries of emerging super mega-city regions by the social indicators based on the human mobility pattern, testing if the implicit boundaries match the administrative/planning boundaries. <br>
c. To use human mobility data and the implicit boundary for analysing the urban spatial structure during the evolution of cities toward super mega-city regions. <br>
d. To establish a simulation model to predict how the specific urban interventions and policy can influence the human mobility pattern and related social indicators, further affecting the urban spatial structure. <br>
Research Methodology Step 1: Using spatial-temporal analysis for revealing the difference of mobility patterns between intra-city and inter-city travel behaviour. Step 2: Developing the spatial interaction models to fit the dynamic boundaries for simulating Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou/GBA urban integration scenarios. Step 3: Purposing a new quantitative analytic framework for measuring the spatial structure of the mega-city region by human mobility pattern and implicit boundary. Step 4: Establishing a regression model to understand the location choice and movement pattern for different social groups. Step 5: Establishing a simulation model by integrating all of the sub-model above, predicting how the specific urban interventions and policy can influence the urban spatial structure by affecting the human mobility pattern.
